# Real Estate Price Estimator

This project is an end-to-end solution for estimating real estate prices using machine learning techniques. It provides a streamlined workflow for predicting house prices based on various features, making it useful for anyone interested in data-driven property valuation.

## Overview

The Real Estate Price Estimator leverages a machine learning model to analyze historical housing data and predict the price of a property. The project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to understand the data, follow the modeling process, and experiment with your own changes.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Detailed analysis and visualization of real estate datasets.
- **Feature Engineering:** Careful selection and transformation of features to improve model performance.
- **Model Building:** Implementation of regression algorithms to estimate house prices.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessment of model accuracy using appropriate metrics.
- **Deployment Ready:** The notebook can be adapted for deployment as a web app or API for practical use.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aysh34/Real-Estate-Price-Estimator.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   Most of the work is done in Jupyter Notebook, so ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed. Required libraries typically include pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or install packages individually as needed.

3. **Run the notebook:**
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the notebook file and follow the steps inside.
